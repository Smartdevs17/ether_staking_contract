// ERC20 Staking Smart Contract

// Objective: Write an ERC20 staking smart contract that allows users to stake a specific ERC20 token for rewards.

// Requirements:
// Users should be able to stake the ERC20 token by transferring the tokens to the contract.
// The contract should track the amount and duration of each userâ€™s stake.
// Implement a reward mechanism similar to the Ether staking contract, where rewards are based on the staking duration.
// Users should be able to withdraw their staked tokens and the rewards after the staking period.
// The contract should handle ERC20 token transfers securely and efficiently.
